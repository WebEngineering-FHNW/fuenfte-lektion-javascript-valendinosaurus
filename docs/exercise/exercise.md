Matrikel Number: 09-067-778

Project idea short description: Overview and Calculator for Marks and Modules at any University.

The Tool will provide funtionality in order to create and manage modules, their exams and exercices.
It will use a custom REST-Client for Database-Funnctionality, the rest will be delivered as grails application.

### planned workflow:
    
    1.  user logs in
    2. a. user displays his modules and marks
    3. a. user creates new modulegrouo
    3. b. user creates new module (if there is min. 1 modulegroup)
    3. c. user creates new mark (if there is min. 1 module)
    3. d. user saves changes
    4. user logs out
    
### functionality:
    
    1. organizing marks, exercises and modules
    2. calculating values overall, module group wide, or single module
    3. Login (meaning everyone can enter his own values)
    4. database management on personal server, access via REST-interface
    
### not in scope
    
    1. no PW-recovery functionality
